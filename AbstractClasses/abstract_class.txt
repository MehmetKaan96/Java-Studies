There are two types of classes in java
1-Abstract
2-Concrete

Difference between concrete and abstract class is that you can create
objects of concrete class, but you cannot create an object of an abstract 
class but you can create a reference.

Consider Super is an abstract class.
✓Super s1;(allowed)//this is a reference of a super class
X s1 = new Super();(it's not allowed) 

Consider Sub is a concrete class.
✓ Sub s2 = new Sub();(it's allowed)

Abstract Method and Abstract Class

What is abstract method: A method which is not having a body
Example:
abstract void method();//No {} here

What is abstract class: If a class is having at least one abstract method
than class also become abstract(if a class has zero abstract method 
then it can also become a abstract class)
If any class is inheriting from an abstract class, than that class is also
become an abstract class.(To become a concrete class the inheriting class
should override the abstract method(s))

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Why we need abstract classes

to provide common method implementation to all the subclasses or to 
provide default implementation.
